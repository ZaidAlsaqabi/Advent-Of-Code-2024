# üéÑ Advent of Code 2024 - C++ Solutions

Welcome to my Advent of Code 2024 solutions repository! This year, I'm taking on the challenge using C++ to sharpen my programming skills and compete globally. Advent of Code is a series of daily programming puzzles that start on December 1st and continue until December 25th this year, I have achived in some days high global ranking in the leaderboard and on private UWE leaderboard rank 1 in ranking during endavour of solving the puzzles‚ôü.

## üéØ Goals
- Improve C++ proficiency
- Practice problem-solving skills
- Learn optimization techniques
- Learn new algorithms and data structures
- Compete for global leaderboard rankings
- Build a repository completed with all the solutions using C++

## üåü Progress (December 2024)
